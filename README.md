# Vesuvius Challenge :microscope:


- Our team won silver medal here, 39th place out of 1,249 teams ðŸ¥³

- It was a computer-vision project, about detecting ink from 3D X-ray scans and reading the contents. Read more at the [comp. link here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection).
- Repo: https://github.com/viktorcikojevic/vesuvius-challenge
- I also have a "deprecated" branch here, which is basically the same code, but it is not as clean as the main branch. There, all the experiments were performed in notebooks and it's difficult to get back to it ðŸ˜…: https://github.com/viktorcikojevic/vesuvius-challenge/tree/deprecated
- Inference notebook that led to the best score: https://www.kaggle.com/code/viktorcikojevic/fork-of-ensemble-all-models?scriptVersionId=141978154


# Neutrino IceCube Challenge :ice_cube:

- A Sequence modelling problem. The goal of this competition is to predict a neutrino particleâ€™s direction. Read more at the [comp. link here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icecube-neutrinos-in-deep-ice).

- I've made some public notebooks:
  - Public EDA notebook: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/viktorcikojevic/transformer-model-train](https://www.kaggle.com/code/viktorcikojevic/very-simple-eda-neutrino-trajectories)https://www.kaggle.com/code/viktorcikojevic/very-simple-eda-neutrino-trajectories
