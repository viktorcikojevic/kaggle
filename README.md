# Vesuvius Challenge :microscope:


- Our team won silver medal here, 39th place out of 1,249 teams ðŸ¥³

- Competition description:

In this competition you are tasked with detecting ink from 3D X-ray scans and reading the contents. Thousands of scrolls were part of a library located in a Roman villa in Herculaneum, a town next to Pompeii. This villa was buried by the Vesuvius eruption nearly 2000 years ago. Due to the heat of the volcano, the scrolls were carbonized, and are now impossible to open without breaking them. These scrolls were discovered a few hundred years ago and have been waiting to be read using modern techniques. There is a $700,000 grand prize available to the first team that can read these scrolls from a 3D X-ray scan. This Kaggle competition hosts the Ink Detection Progress Prize.

- I also have a "deprecated" branch here, which is basically the same code, but it is not as clean as the main branch. There, all the experiments were performed in notebooks and it's difficult to get back to it ðŸ˜…: https://github.com/viktorcikojevic/vesuvius-challenge/tree/deprecated



# Neutrino IceCube Challenge :ice_cube:

- Competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icecube-neutrinos-in-deep-ice

- Competition description:


The goal of this competition is to predict a neutrino particleâ€™s direction. You will develop a model based on data from the "IceCube" detector, which observes the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice.
